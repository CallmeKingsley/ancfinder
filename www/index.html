          <h2 id="AboutANC">What Are ANCs?</h2>
          <p>Washington DC is divided into 40 districts called Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, or ANCs. Each ANC has 7-8 ANC commissioners, who are your most local government representative in DC.</p>
          <p>ANCs hold regular meetings and make decisions about a range of issues, including traffic, parking, recreation, street improvements, liquor licenses, zoning, economic development, police protection, sanitation and trash collection, and the District's annual budget. Learn more about ANC authority.</p>
          <p>Each ANC is divided into 7-8 Single Member Districts, or SMDs. Commissioners are each elected from Single Member Districts, and they each represent about 2,000 DC residents. There are 296 ANC commissioners (and SMDs) in the District.</p>
          <p>You elect your ANC Commissioner every two years. They do not receive a salary, but they receive grant money for the general purpose of improving their area and hiring staff. Learn more about ANC grant money.</p>
          <h2>Why should I care about my ANC?</h2>
          <p>In addition to awarding grant money as they see fit, ANC Commissioners’ main power comes from making decisions about neighborhood issues and then advising the DC Council and DC government agencies to take action - and this is nearly always the final decision in a matter.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            
            <p>Our goals are evolving as we get to know the ANC system better. Here are the goals we are considering:</p>
            
            <ul>
            	<li>Educate the public on DC&rsquo;s unique ANC system.</li>
            	<li>Provide tools for ANC commissioners to connect with their constituents and to more easily publish official ANC records.</li>
            	<li>Help DC residents locate their ANC, its meetings, and the commissioner from their SMD.</li>
            	<li>Inspire DC residents to be involved in the ANC system.</li>
            	<li>Promote transparency and accountability bylaw recommendations.</li>

        	<h2>Tasks</h2>
        	
        	<p>We&rsquo;re working on the following tasks. Please come to <a href="http://codefordc.org/">our next meeting</a> if you would like to help!</p>
        	
        	<ul>
        		<li>What are ANCs? What are their responsibilities? Write up an explanation.</li>
        		<li>What is the legal basis of ANCs in the DC code?</li>
        		<li>What information exists on the <a href="http://anc.dc.gov">official ANC website</a>?</li>
        		<li>Gathering a list of existing ANC websites.</li>
        		<li>Building a find-your-ANC/commissioner tool.</li>
        	</ul>
        	
        	<p>And we are thinking about:</p>
        	
        	<ul>
        		<li>Find an intuitive way to explain the ANC system on this website.</li>
        		<li>Determine what are all of the different sorts of documents produced by ANCs.</li>
        		<li>Investigate what tools would be useful for commissioners (blog, CMS, wiki, etc.).</li>
        		<li>Recruiting liaisons in each ANC to help record and share information about their ANC's activities.</li>
