				<h2>What is an ANC?</h2>
				<p>Washington DC is divided into 40 districts called Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, or ANCs.</p>
				<p>ANCs are lead by an average of 7-8 commissioners who are your most local government representative in DC.</p>
				<p>ANC commissioners make decisions about a broad range of issues in your community, such as liquor licenses, parking, and sanitation.</p>

				<h2>Single Member Districts</h2>
				<p>Each ANC has 2-12 ANC commissioners who represent a division of the ANC called a Single Member District, or SMD. Commissioners each represent about 2,000 DC residents who live in the SMD.</p>

				<h2>What do ANCs do? Why should I care?</h2>
				<p>ANCs hold regular meetings and make decisions about many important community issues, such as parking, recreation, street improvements, liquor licenses, zoning, restaurants and businesses, police protection, sanitation and trash collection, and the District's annual budget.</p>
				<p>Your ANC commissioners also control grant money of several thousand dollars (or more) for the general purpose of improving their area and hiring staff. Learn more about ANC authority and budget.</p>

ANC campaigns are typically small, grassroots efforts: winning candidates often run unopposed and receive just a few hundred votes. Learn more about running for ANC commissioner.</p>
